    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: brown;text-align: center;font-size: 35px;border-bottom: 1px dashed;">Hazrat Muhammad Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam</h1>
    <p style="background-image: url(image/img1.jpg);background-size: cover;background-size: 100% 100%;">Muhammad (Sm), Hazrat Prophet Muhammad (Sm) was born in the Year of the Elephant (Amul-e-Fil), when the Yemeni ruler Ashabul Fil Abraha tried to attack the Holy Ka'ba (Baitullah) with an army and elephants in his train. It was on a Monday in the month of Rabiul Awwal in the Arabic calendar that Hazrat Muhammad (Sm) was born. There are four different dates cited by various authorities as his birthday: the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 12th day of the month of Rabiul Awwal. But there is no doubt that he was born on the Monday that fell between the 8th and 12th that month. Majority of Islamic scholars believe that the 12th of Rabiul Awwal is the most probable date. Hafiz Ibne Hazar Al-Askalani and Ibne Aseer are among those who have accepted this date. It should be noted that according to some historians the Prophet's date of birth coincided with the attack that was carried out by Abraha on 20 April 570 or 571, although others have mentioned 19 April and 21 April as possible dates.Muhammad's (Sm) father Abdullah died when he was still in his mother's womb. After he was born, his mother named him Ahmed. However, his grandfather Abdul Muttalib named him Muhammad (Sm) since he desired his grand-son to be admired by everyone in all ages. His Akika or naming ceremony was organised a few days after his birth by his grandfather. Muhammad (Sm) was at first suckled by his mother Amina. After two or three days he was breast-fed by Suwaibah, a slave-girl of his uncle Abu Lahab. As was the practice in the then aristocratic Arab families, he was given over to a wet nurse named Halima Sadia belonging to the Taif's Sad tribe, who was also entrusted with the responsibility of bringing him up. He spent the first five years of his life with her.Muhammad (Sm) used to graze goats and sheep in the fields with his foster-brother Abdullah. But he would not then indulge in childish pranks or pick up quarrels, as boys are wont to do. While shepherding a flock of goats and sheep two angels once made an incision into his heart and purified it by extracting a black clot of blood from it. The black clot of blood was the source of all sin and evil designs. When Muhammad (Sm) was six years old his mother Amina died. His grandfather Abdul Muttalib then took the responsibility of bringing up the child.However, he was not able to enjoy the benefit of his grandfather's affection for a long time since he too died when the Prophet was only eight years old. His uncle Abu Taleb was then entrusted with the duty of raising him. The young boy used to busy himself with the shepherding of the flock in the fields and with household works. His school was the open sky and the desert landscape and mountains where he worked. When the Prophet (Sm) was twelve years old Abu Taleb took him along on a business trip to Syria. According to the custom of his family, the Prophet entered business at the age of twenty.In his dealings and transactions, Muhammad (Sm) earned a great reputation for his honesty, magnanimity, virtuous conduct, and trustworthiness. In fact, he won the confidence and trust of everyone and was thus given the title of 'Al-Ameen' for his probity and reliability. It was due to this fact that the Prophet Muhammad (Sm) was entrusted with the responsibility of re-establishing the sacred Hazre Aswad when the Holy Ka'ba was re-built.On hearing about Muhammad's (Sm) diligence, sense of responsibility, honesty, and other remarkable qualities, Khadija (R), an intelligent and sagacious lady having exceptional moral standards together with profound experience in worldly affairs, invited him to become her business partner. Muhammad (Sm) agreed to her proposal and set out on a business trip to Syria in this capacity. During this trip he handled the business dealings skillfully and managed to make a handsome profit by selling the goods he had brought along. He purchased different commodities from Syria and handed them over to Khadiza (R). When he returned to Makkah Khadija (R) earned a big profit by selling these commodities.</p>

    <h1 style=" text-align: center;color: brown;border-bottom: 1px dashed;font-size: 30px;font-family: "> Prophet Mohammad's life history</h1>
    <h1 style="color: darkgreen;border-bottom: 1 px dashed;">Who Was Muhammad?</h1>
    <p style="font-family: cursive;text-align: justify;">Muhammad was the prophet and founder of Islam. Most of his early life was spent as a merchant. At age 40, he began to have revelations from Allah that became the basis for the Koran and the foundation of Islam. By 630 he had unified most of Arabia under a single religion. As of 2015, there are over 1.8 billion Muslims in the world who profess, “There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet.</p>
    <h1 style="color: darkgreen; border-bottom: 1 px dashed;">The Life of Muhammad</h1>
    <p style="font-family: cursive; text-align: justify;line-height: 1.2;">Muhammad was born around 570, AD in Mecca (now in Saudi Arabia). His father died before he was born and he was raised first by his grandfather and then his uncle. He belonged to a poor but respectable family of the Quraysh tribe. The family was active in Meccan politics and trade.Many of the tribes living in the Arabian Peninsula at the time were nomadic, trading goods as they crisscrossed the desert. Most tribes were polytheistic, worshipping their own set of gods. The town of Mecca was an important trading and religious center, home to many temples and worship sites where the devoted prayed to the idols of these gods. The most famous site was the Kaaba (meaning cube in Arabic). It is believed to have been built by Abraham (Ibrahim to Muslims) and his son Ismail. Gradually the people of Mecca turned to polytheism and idolatry. Of all the gods worshipped, it is believed that Allah was considered the greatest and the only one without an idol.</p>
    <h1 style="color: darkgreen;"> The Prophet Muhammad</h1>
    <p style="font-family: cursive; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2;">Muhammad was also very religious, occasionally taking journeys of devotion to sacred sites near Mecca. On one of his pilgrimages in 610, he was meditating in a cave on Mount Jabal aI-Nour. The Angel Gabriel appeared and relayed the word of God: “Recite in the name of your Lord who creates, creates man from a clot! Recite for your lord is most generous….” These words became the opening verses of sūrah (chapter) 96 of the Qur'an. Most Islamic historians believe Muhammad was initially disturbed by the revelations and that he didn’t reveal them publicly for several years. However, Shi’a tradition states he welcomed the message from the Angel Gabriel and was deeply inspired to share his experience with other potential believers.</p>
    <h1 style="color: darkgreen;">The Death of Muhammad</h1>
    <p style="font-family: cursive;text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2;">After the conflict with Mecca was finally settled, Muhammad took his first true Islamic pilgrimage to that city and in March, 632, he delivered his last sermon at Mount Arafat. Upon his return to Medina to his wife’s home, he fell ill for several days. He died on June 8, 632, at the age of 62, and was buried at al-Masjid an-Nabawi (the Mosque of the Prophet) one of the first mosques built by Muhammad in Medina.</p>
